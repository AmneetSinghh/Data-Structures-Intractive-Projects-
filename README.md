<h2 style="color:green;">These are some Intractive Games which I made using the javascript, Phaser and html5. In every game,
I am showing the real world application of Data Structures.</h2>
1. <b>Snake Game </b>:
  In this game, I used Array of Pairs (Data Structures) and shown how we can use the array of pairs to make the game.
  
2. <b>Covid Player Game</b>
In this game, I used Collision Detection algorithm. When my player collide with the corona_virus then it will effect its health.
