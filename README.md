<h2 style="color:green;">These are some Intractive Games which I made using the javascript, Phaser and html5. In every game,
I am showing the real world application of Data Structures.</h2>
1. <b>Snake Game </b>:
  In this game, I used Array of Pairs (Data Structures) and shown how we can use the array of pairs to make the game.

2.<b>Covid Player Game:</b>
In this game, I used Collision Detection algorithm. When my player collide with the corona_virus then it will effect its health.
3.<b>Spin-Win Game:</b>
In this game, I used the Phaser Framework in javascript to make a simple spin-win game. when the user click on the wheel, it will rool for some random
seconds then it will show you the result. I used concepsts image loading, spride and tweens in phaser.
